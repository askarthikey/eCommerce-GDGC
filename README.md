   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

### Shopping Experience
The `index.html` file contains the main product catalog. Users can browse the available products, view their details, and add them to their shopping cart by clicking the cart icon in the top-right corner.

### Cart Functionality
The `cart.html` file manages the user's shopping cart. Users can view the items in their cart, update quantities, and remove items as needed. The total amount is displayed at the bottom of the cart.

## Development

### HTML
The HTML files, `index.html` and `cart.html`, structure the content and layout of the ShopSphere platform. These files define the various sections, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout process.

### CSS
The CSS files, `index.css` and `cart.css`, handle the visual styling of the ShopSphere platform. These files define the colors, fonts, and layout of the various elements on the page.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript files, `index.js` and `cart.js`, adds interactivity to the ShopSphere platform. This includes functions to manage the shopping cart, update the cart count, and toggle the checkout section.
